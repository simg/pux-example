# Pux Starter App

A demo / tutorial app for Pux demonstrating usage of:

 * WebSockets 
 * calling API's
 * parsing JSON
 * form handling 
 * structure for larger apps
 * date / time parsing

Currently the back end uses postgrest (http://postgrest.com/) though I'm not sure I'll stick with
that for various reasons (mostly lack of strong typing in stored procedures)

I'm not currently ready to release the back end code and the front end code still needs a lot of work
so really you can't yet run the App to see it in action.

There's plenty that doesn't work, plenty that isn't implemented and loads of shoddy code that I'm still learning to fix.

If what I have here is helpful to you, great. Something like this would have been very helpful to me a few months ago even in it's current form.

Not for product use, obviously :)
